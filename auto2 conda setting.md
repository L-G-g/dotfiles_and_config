# Setting Up a Conda Environment for Bioinformatics and Computational Chemistry

This guide walks you through creating a Conda environment named `auto2`, equipped with essential packages for bioinformatics and computational chemistry. The environment leverages packages from reputable channels like `conda-forge` and `bioconda`, along with specific versions of software like `autodock-gpu` and `openbabel`.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Conda installed on your system. If not, download and install it from the official website.

## Steps to Create the Environment

1. **Open Terminal or Anaconda Prompt**: Start by opening your terminal (Linux/macOS) or Anaconda Prompt (Windows).

2. **Execute the Creation Command**: Run the following command to create the `auto2` environment with the necessary packages.
```console
bash conda create -n auto2 -c conda-forge -c bioconda biopython hcc::autodock-gpu pandas conda-forge::openbabel
```

This command performs several actions:
- `-n auto2`: Names the new environment as `auto2`.
- `-c conda-forge -c bioconda`: Directs Conda to search for packages in the `conda-forge` and `bioconda` channels.
- `biopython`: Installs the Biopython library, crucial for biological computation.
- `hcc::autodock-gpu`: Adds the AutoDock GPU version from the HCC channel, aiding in molecular docking simulations.
- `pandas`: Incorporates the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis.
- `conda-forge::openbabel`: Installs Open Babel from the Conda Forge channel, facilitating chemical file conversion and manipulation.

3. **Activate the New Environment**: To begin using the `auto2` environment, activate it with the following command:
```console
bash conda activate auto2
```

Your environment is now ready for use, equipped with the installed packages for bioinformatics and computational chemistry tasks.
